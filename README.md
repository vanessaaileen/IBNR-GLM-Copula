The code performs loss reserving analysis, a crucial process in insurance to estimate future claims based on historical data. 
It specifically aims to model and predict IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported) claims, which are claims that have occurred but not yet been reported to the insurer for three lines of business: commercial auto, home, and workers' compensation.


- The code highlights the importance of modeling dependence between different lines of business for accurate IBNR estimation.
- It demonstrates the use of simulations to quantify uncertainty in loss reserving estimates.
- The specific data, model choices, and results would need further exploration to draw more concrete conclusions.
- Explore the use of both Chain Ladder and GLM methods, as well as copulas to model dependence between lines of business.
- The data is from CASdatasets "ustri2GL" : a list of three triangles for three line-of-business: commercial automobile businesses, homeowners, workers' compensation from Kirschner, Kerley and Isaacs (2002). These are cumulative paid amounts in thousands of dollars.
